    /// Implemetation of Distance Matrix Generator class via Kimura method.
    /// 
    /// Generates a distance matrix from a set of *aligned* sequences by Kimura distance 
    /// method. See paper:
    /// MUSCLE: a multiple sequence alignment method with reduced time and space complexity. 
    /// Edgar, 2004, for details.
    /// 
    /// An additive distance measure is defined so d(A,B) = d(A,C) + d(B,C). 
    /// The mutation distance is trivially additive. Given the fractional identity D
    /// (percent identity), the mutation distance can be approximated as 1-D.
    /// As sequences diverge, there is an increasing probability of multiple mutations
    /// at a single site. Kimura correction is used here to correct this problem.
    /// 
    /// The generator is an O(N^2) algorithm. In the double loop, the generator calculates
    /// percent identity of each pair, and converts it to kimura distance score. These two 
    /// functions are defined in class KimuraDistanceScoreCalculator.
    /// 
    /// The distances will be stored in a symmetric square distance matrix, where rows and 
    /// cols are sequences, and elements are distance scores. The distance matrix is then 
    /// used to generate binary guide tree by hierarchical clustering method.
