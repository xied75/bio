NUCmer Utility v1.1
Copyright (c) 2011-2013, The Outercurve Foundation.

NucmerUtil and MummerUtil are .NET re-implementations of MUMmer 3.0, which was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants IIS-9902923 and IIS-9820497, and by the National Institutes of Health under grants R01-LM06845 and N01-AI-15447.  The development of the original reference was a joint effort by Stefan Kurtz of the University of Hamburg and Adam Phillippy, Art Delcher and Steven Salzberg at TIGR.

Usage: NucmerUtil.exe [options] <reference file> <query file>

NUCmer(NUCleotide MUMmer): Aligns multiple reference and multiple query
                           sequences in a many vs. many fashion.

Options:

-m:             Use anchor matches that are unique in both the reference and query.

-r:             Use anchor matches that are unique in the reference but
                not necessarily unique in the query(default behavior).

-x:             Use all anchor matches regardless of their uniqueness.

-b:<int>        Distance an alignment extension will attempt to extend poor scoring
                regions before giving up (default 200).

-c:<int>        Minimum cluster length (default 65).

-d:<double>     Maximum diagonal difference factor for clustering,i.e. diagonal
                difference / match separation (default 0.12).

-f              Align only the forward strand of the query sequence to the forward
                strand of the reference.

-g:<int>        Maximum gap between two adjacent matches in a cluster (default 90).

-h              Print the help information.

-l:<int>        Minimum length of an maximal exact match (default 20).

-o:<string>     Output file.

-e              Align only the reverse strand of the query sequence to the forward
                strand of the reference.

-n              Toggle the outward extension of alignments from their anchoring
                clusters.Setting this flag will prevent alignment extensions but
                still align the DNA between clusteredmatches and create the .delta
                file.

-v              Display verbose logging during processing.
